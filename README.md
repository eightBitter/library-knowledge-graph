Library Knowledge Graph Project
===============================

This is a personal attempt at creating a library knowledge graph that represents NCSU Libraries (collections, people, services, events, spaces, technology, etc).

## Plan

- [x] Design templates for each entity type
- [ ] Come up with a taxonomy for connecting entities
- [ ] Create 10 example records for each entity
- [ ] Ingest records into GraphDB and run some queries to explore relationships
- [ ] Install question-answer software (check earlier research notes for particular software)
- [ ] Create use-case examples
  - Related content (Amazon)
  - Smart search
  - Research tracks?

## To Do Next

- Create a few records for each service category
