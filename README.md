Library Knowledge Graph Project
===============================

This is a personal attempt at creating a library knowledge graph that represents NCSU Libraries (collections, people, services, events, spaces, technology, etc).

## Plan

- Design templates for each entity type
- Come up with a taxonomy for connecting entities
- Create 10 example records for each entity
- Ingest records into GraphDB and run some queries to explore relationships
- Install question-answer software (check earlier research notes for particular software)
- Create use-case examples
  - Related content (Amazon)
  - Smart search
  - Research tracks?
