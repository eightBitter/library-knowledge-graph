R can be used for multiple purposes, including statistics, data cleaning, visualization and creating data-driven web applications. R is very useful for producing publication-quality graphs from data.

This workshop is an introduction to R for absolute beginners who have little or no prior experience with coding. No experience with coding is expected. If you have a solid coding background, this workshop may be too introductory for you.",
