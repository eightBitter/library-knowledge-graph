  "description":"Narrated by Matt Damon, this feature-length documentary explores the growing privatization of public schools and the resulting impact on Americaâ€™s most vulnerable children. Filmed in Philadelphia, New Orleans, Nashville and other cities, Backpack Full of Cash takes viewers through the tumultuous 2013-14 school year, exposing the world of corporate-driven education \"reform\" where public education -- starved of resources -- hangs in the balance. Panel discussion with public education leaders will follow the film along with Q&A from audience.",
