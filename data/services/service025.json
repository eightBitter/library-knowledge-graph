  "description": "A laser cutter is an amazingly powerful digital fabrication tool used for computationally cutting and engraving a variety of materials. At the D.H. Hill Makerspace, we offer a laser cutting service to all current NCSU students, faculty, and staff. The service costs are $5 per 15 minutes of appointment time, with a $10 minimum, plus material costs. We will only cut or engrave materials that we have sourced, listed below.

You do not need to attend a Makerspace Orientation prior to your appointment. For safety reasons, only library staff are able to operate the laser cutter.

Design guidelines: In preparing your files (e.g. in Illustrator or Inkscape), please use a canvas of 11.5" x 23.5" and for your cut lines use paths with a stroke weight of 0.001 inches. Any content of thicker weight will be engraved rather than cut.",
